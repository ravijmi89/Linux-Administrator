Journaling Mount Options

    -data=journal: The highest level. The one that does the most journaling. This writes the journal entries for all the data and metadata changes. All data is committed into the journal before being written into the main file system.
    -data=ordered: The default mode. All data is forced directly out to the main file system before its metadata is committed to the journal.
    -data=writeback: The lowest level. Data ordering is not preserved. Data can be written into the main file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal.
mount –o nouser,ro /dev/xvdf1 /test
