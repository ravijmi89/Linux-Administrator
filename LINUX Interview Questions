Question 1: Explain Booting procedure or steps in Linux?

1. Once System powered on, it automatically invokes BIOS

2. BIOS will start the processor and perform a POST [power on self test] to check the connected device are ready to use and are working properly.

3. After POST ,  BIOS will check for the booting device. The boot sector is always the first sector of the hard disk and BIOS will load the MBR into the memory.
   MBR holds the boot loader of the OS.

4. Then boot loader takes the control of the booting process.

5. GRUB is the boot loader for Linux.

6. Depending on the boot option selected the kernel is loaded first.

7. After kernel is loaded the kernel will take the control of the booting process

8. Initrd will be loaded which contains drivers to detect hardware (its called Initialization of RAM Disk)

9. Then it will initialize all the hardware including I/O processors etc.

10. Kernel will mounts the root partition as read-only

11. INIT is loaded as the first process.

12. INIT will mount the root partition and other partitions as read/write and checks for file system errors.

13. Sets the System Clock, hostname etc..

14. Based on the Runlevel, it will load the services and runs the startup scripts which are located in /etc/rcX.d/ (Network, nfs, SSH etc.)

15. Finally it runs the rc.local script & Now the login prompt will appear.

What is stage 1.5 boot loaded in linux?

GRUB Stage 1.5 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR and before the first partition. 
If this space is not available (Unusual partition table, special disk drivers, GPT or LVM disk), 
the installation of Stage 1.5 will fail. The stage 1.5 image contains file system drivers.
Stage 1 Boot loaded is : MBR
Stage 1.5 Boo loader : e2fs_stage1_5
Stage 2 Boot loader is  : GRUB

Booting into rescue mode and reinstalling GRUB2

1. Boot from the RHEL7 installation DVD by altering the boot order in Bios and selecting DVD media as the first booting preference.
Note : Older version of RHEL 7 DVD will not work here. So make sure you have latest version RHEL 7 DVD with you.

2. At the boot screen, Select the Troubleshooting option at the end of the screen.
3. At the next screen, select the option Rescue a CentOS Linux system.
4. On the next screen, press enter to continue. When asked if you would like Rescue to find your installation, choose Continue.
If you run into trouble detecting your install, retry using the Skip option and manually detect and mount your storage. 
You would get a message shown in the picture below if the rescue mode has detected the correct installation.

5. Next step is to change your root directory to /mnt/sysimage using the chroot command. This makes your system the root environment.
# chroot /mnt/sysimage

6. Use the grub2-install command to re-write the MBR to your boot device. The boot device is usually /dev/sda.
# grub2-install /dev/sda
You should get a successful installation message as shown below.

 Question 4:  Linux Booting Issues : How to solve ??

Option 1: init not found error
Option 2: Run fsck on all FS in rescue mode
Option 3: Reinstall GRUB
Option 4: Recover grub.conf / grub configuration

Option 1: For normal panic and "init not found" error.

Error : "init not found" displayed

1) Launch the system to Bash shell prompt

Reboot the server and interrupt to edit the GRUB.

Edit grub and enter the below in last

init=/bin/bash

Then save and exit and boot the server. This will launch you straight into a Bash shell prompt.Then you can remount “/” file system and check /var/log/messages for any error.

Note :  init=/bin/bash (Grub boot loader) or linux init=/bin/bash (if Lilo boot loader).

2) Once server booted and if it is in Bash shell prompt

 #mount -o remount,rw /

3) Now  you can check the log messages and try to find the reason for server pacnic or error.

#more /var/log/messages


Option 2:  If the above option not helped then follow the next

1) Boot from the Linux First CD (boot CD).

2) Type “boot rescue” at Linux boot prompt.

3) After the bash shell prompt show up, type the below command

   # chroot /mnt/sysimage

a) Run fsck and Check for any disk error

  #fdisk -l /dev/sda  //check how many partion you have

   then run fsck on each partition
    
  #fsck -y /dev/sda2'

Option 3: If the above also not helped then reinstall grub and retry.

 In rescue mode.

   #  chroot /mnt/sysimage

   # /sbin/grub-install /dev/hda
