Question 1: Explain Booting procedure or steps in Linux?

1. Once System powered on, it automatically invokes BIOS

2. BIOS will start the processor and perform a POST [power on self test] to check the connected device are ready to use and are working properly.

3. After POST ,  BIOS will check for the booting device. The boot sector is always the first sector of the hard disk and BIOS will load the MBR into the memory.
   MBR holds the boot loader of the OS.

4. Then boot loader takes the control of the booting process.

5. GRUB is the boot loader for Linux.

6. Depending on the boot option selected the kernel is loaded first.

7. After kernel is loaded the kernel will take the control of the booting process

8. Initrd will be loaded which contains drivers to detect hardware (its called Initialization of RAM Disk)

9. Then it will initialize all the hardware including I/O processors etc.

10. Kernel will mounts the root partition as read-only

11. INIT is loaded as the first process.

12. INIT will mount the root partition and other partitions as read/write and checks for file system errors.

13. Sets the System Clock, hostname etc..

14. Based on the Runlevel, it will load the services and runs the startup scripts which are located in /etc/rcX.d/ (Network, nfs, SSH etc.)

15. Finally it runs the rc.local script & Now the login prompt will appear.
